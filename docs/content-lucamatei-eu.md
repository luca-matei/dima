# About

## Hey there,
I'm Luca and I appeared 20 years ago, in the lands of Eastern Europe, in Romania. Loyalty, versatility, persistence and responsibility are the cornerstones of my practice. I commit with enthusiasm to my goals and to the causes I support.  

I'm able to handle stressful situations such as getting past the most difficult obstacles in my career or even when I used to make ends meet back in the time I worked in retail. Versatility proved to be a key skill since I had to switch between working on my projects, studying and keeping a part-time job.

Although I've been seriously learning web development and system management for just over 4 years, my passion for IT started 13 years ago, with Python. I used to create scripts to solve math problems from various coding websites such as [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). Now I'm automating daily and work-related tasks, I'm managing my projects in a centralized environment and I've built tools and frameworks to serve my web applications. Apart from this, I've wandered around 3D modelling, game development, writing fiction and photography.  

As a personal note, I love trains, as I spend my free time documenting railway networks and their rolling stock from Romania. Other times, I enjoy biking and building contraptions.

### Frontend
- Can implement HTML5 and CSS3 from UI/UX design mockups. Can troubleshoot and improve designs and accessibility issues. Can work with common JS frameworks (e.g. mithril.js) and libraries (e.g. jQuery). Can work with the AJAX model. Can use JS (e.g. Transcrypt) and CSS (e.g. Sass) preprocessors. I've created my own Front-End framework, it's part of the [DIMA Project](projects/dima).  
- Can learn Angular, React, Node or Django if needed.

### SysAdmin
- Can perform utility tasks on Linux-based hosts (e.g. Debian). Can setup user access (e.g. sudo). Can configure key-based SSH connections. Can work with relational databases (e.g. Postgres). Can work with project management tools (e.g. GIT). Can create KVM and VirtualBox machines. Can remaster ISO images to preseed Debian for fully automated installs. Can manage public cloud Linux VPSes. Can create mail servers. I've created a system to automate daily and work-related tasks, it's part of the [DIMA Project](projects/dima).

- Can learn Ansible if needed.


## Core Expertise
### Growth mindset
As the IT world is in constant change, keeping my projects in check with the latest architectures and technologies requires persistent learning. I love learning, especially as there are so many things that passionate me and with every piece of knowledge that I gain, I realise there's so much more to it.
### Integrity
Trust takes time to build, but having someone who's serious about their principles and moral values will make that process easier. I commit to my word, I value honesty to the core and all my actions are transparent and in the name of good.
### Time management
Not only that planning my time gives me the ability to accomplish more in a day, but it also gives me a clear direction to where I'm heading at the moment. I can focus on the main things by prioritizing them and deliver the product faster, but, of course, with the promise to work on the details when I have enough time for it.
### Critical thinking
As cliché as it is in all resumes, taking the time to actually think about how an action would affect later on, significantly reduced the magnitude of certain issues that arised in the project development. It's easier to rewrite a part of code than restructure the whole project. So far, developing this skill has helped me make the best decisions in crisis times.
### Receptive
Maybe my ideas seem to be the best at first, but considering other's suggestions can be a much better pick, as I'm given another perspective on the matter I'm working on. After critically assessing what would take to apply the new idea, I always give a feedback stating why we should or should not use it. Sharing knowledge is way easier than learning on my own.
### Communication
Although I love working independently, I genuinely believe that relationships and teams heavily rely on communication because otherwise I could disrupt other's work, duplicate it or even destroy it. This is what keeps everything together, the people, the internet, ourselves.

- Dima is a remarkable tool that I developed for automating work-related tasks when creating and managing software like programs and scripts, apps, and web applications. Its comprehensive functionality includes the management of DHCP, DNS, Web, and Mail servers. Dima allows developers to manage the entire digital infrastructure, visuals, and deployment of websites using self-made CMS, backend, and front-end frameworks, along with tools for deployment and monitoring.
