# About

## Hey there,
I'm Luca and I appeared 20 years ago, in the lands of Eastern Europe, in Romania. Loyalty, versatility, persistence and responsibility are the cornerstones of my practice. I commit with enthusiasm to my goals and to the causes I support.  

I'm able to handle stressful situations such as getting past the most difficult obstacles in my career or even when I used to make ends meet back in the time I worked in retail. Versatility proved to be a key skill since I had to switch between working on my projects, studying and keeping a part-time job.

Although I've been seriously learning web development and system management for just over 4 years, my passion for IT started 13 years ago, with Python. I used to create scripts to solve math problems from various coding websites such as [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). Now I'm automating daily and work-related tasks, I'm managing my projects in a centralized environment and I've built tools and frameworks to serve my web applications. Apart from this, I've wandered around 3D modelling, game development, writing fiction and photography.  

As a personal note, I love trains, as I spend my free time documenting railway networks and their rolling stock from Romania. Other times, I enjoy biking and building contraptions.
