# Digital Marmot / Dima

This tool is a complete Python-based solution for building and deploying virtual machines, networks, and web apps in a home lab. It features a command line interface with history and a Tkinter GUI, offering over 65 commands.

It can configure and manage Git repositories, uWSGI servers, Nginx web servers, Letâ€™s Encrypt SSL certificates, system services, Bind DNS servers, DHCP servers, SSH keys, GPG keys, PostgreSQL servers, nftables firewalls (with geo-blocking and port knocking), development, staging, and production environments, as well as preseed Debian virtual machines. Configurations are based on a custom templating system, with every setting carefully selected by me.

Websites are built on a custom web framework based on the WSGI application. They support multilingual content using a YAML-based CMS for managing static, blog, and gallery content.

The frontend of the websites uses a SCSS-based library for multimedia structure, spacing, color palettes, UI components, and animations.

Notes:
- Project was imported from [my Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/lucamatei).
- It's currently in the process of being updated and documented.
- Tokens and IPs found in the code are obsolete (I know it's bad practice).
